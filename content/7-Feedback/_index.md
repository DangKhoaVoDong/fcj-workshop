>Here you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve based on the following categories:

### General Assessment

**1. Working Environment**
The environment at FCJ is extremely dynamic and professional. Participating in events at Bitexco or the AWS Vietnam office helped me clearly feel the culture of a top-tier tech company. Members embody the "Builder" spirit – always ready to build, experiment with new things, and unafraid to share knowledge.

**2. Support from Mentors / Team Admins**
Mentors are not just guides but true technical experts. I was impressed by how they explained complex concepts (like GenAI, DevOps mindset) in practical terms. The Team Admins were very enthusiastic in organizing workshops, ensuring sessions ran smoothly.

**3. Relevance between Work and Major**
The program closely aligns with and expands upon the knowledge I learned at university. While university taught cloud theory, here I saw how AWS is applied in real enterprises (Banking, Fintech, E-commerce). This is the perfect stepping stone for my Cloud Engineer career.

**4. Opportunities for Learning & Skill Development**
Learning opportunities are the highlight of the program. The "Cloud Mastery Series" workshops on AI/ML, Security, and DevOps contained high-value knowledge. I learned not only about tools (AWS Services) but also system design thinking and standardized workflows.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**
The open culture is clearly evident. Even as an intern, my opinions were respected. Team spirit shone brightest during practical workshops, where everyone debugged errors together and shared resources.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**
Beyond basic support, the biggest "benefit" I received was access to AWS learning resources, certification vouchers, and networking opportunities with industry leaders.


### Other Questions

- **What were you most satisfied with during the internship?**
The professional quality of the Workshops and Community Day. I had access to the latest technologies (GenAI, Bedrock) right when they were trending hot in the market.

- **What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?**
I think the program could add "Code Camps" or mini-projects that last throughout the internship so interns have a chance for deeper hands-on practice, rather than just short-term workshops.

- **Would you recommend this internship to your friends? Why?**
Definitely YES. This is the best environment to start a Cloud career in Vietnam. You don't just learn a trade; you join a strong Community that will support you in the long run.


### Suggestions & Wishes

- **Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**
I suggest increasing sharing sessions on soft skills, such as: Technical solution presentation skills, project documentation writing, or specialized English for IT.

- **Do you want to continue with this program in the future?**
I strongly desire to continue accompanying FCJ in higher positions (such as Core Team or Mentor supporting future batches) or have the opportunity to become a full-time employee at partner companies within the ecosystem.

- **Other feedback (free sharing):**
Thank you to the First Cloud Journey organizers for creating such a valuable playground. I hope the community will continue to grow and expand into even more in-depth topics.
