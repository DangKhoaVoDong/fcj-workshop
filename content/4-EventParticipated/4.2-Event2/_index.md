### Key Highlights

The event covered many in-depth topics:

#### 1. GenAI & Chatbots in Enterprise (Enterprise Software & FinTech)
- **Enterprise Chatbot with MCP:** Introduction to building enterprise chatbots with advanced **context handling** using the MCP protocol on AWS.
- **Stock Trading Chatbot:** Live demo of a stock trading chatbot using **Serverless architecture**, ensuring real-time processing and high scalability.

#### 2. Applying GenAI to Life & eCommerce
- **GenAI Kitchen Recipe Recommendation:** A personalized recipe recommendation system powered by GenAI, illustrating workflow design on AWS.
- **Scaling eCommerce:** Leveraging GenAI to optimize customer experience and personalize shopping, while solving the **performance scaling** challenge.

#### 3. Automation with AI Agents (Automation & Audit)
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Applying multi-agent systems to automate complex banking processes.
- **Auto Audit Framework:** Using AI to automate auditing processes, orchestrating workflows between agents to minimize human error.
- **Amazon Nova Act:** Introduction to the new generation AI Agents and Cloud-native solutions for the banking sector.

#### 4. Security & Internal Tools

- **Smart Data Contracts:** Applying GenAI to build and validate smart data contracts, serving Fintech scenarios and large enterprises.

### Key Learnings

#### Technical Knowledge
- **RAG & Serverless:** Gained a deeper understanding of combining RAG with Serverless architecture to build low-cost but highly effective chatbots.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Grasped the concept and power of coordinating multiple AI Agents to solve complex tasks instead of using a single model.
- **Cloud-Native Mindset:** Clearly saw the shift towards Cloud-native architectures in traditional industries like Banking and Auditing.

#### Problem-Solving Mindset
- Technology does not exist in isolation but is always attached to a specific **Business Case**, such as optimizing trading, personalizing shopping experiences, or automating audits.

### Application to Work

- **Research RAG:** Dive deeper into RAG architecture to propose building an internal documentation search tool for the team during the internship.
- **Test AI Agents:** Start exploring **Amazon Bedrock Agents** or frameworks to build a simple automation task.
- **Reference Architecture:** Save the shared reference architecture models to apply when designing systems in the future.

### Event Experience

Participating in the **AWS First Cloud Journey Community Day** at Bitexco was an "overwhelming" experience in a positive way due to the massive amount of knowledge shared.

#### Vibrant Academic Atmosphere
- The **Live Demos** of the Chatbot or Auto Audit were impressive, helping me clearly visualize the transition from theory to reality.
- The Q&A sessions were lively, with speakers openly sharing **lessons learned** and challenges, not just successes.

#### Quality Networking
- The Coffee Break was a great opportunity to connect with passionate students from other universities and interact with the speakers.

#### Key Takeaways
- The event helped me realize that GenAI is no longer just a "buzzword" but has penetrated deep into enterprise business logic. To avoid falling behind, continuous updates on AI Agents and Automation are mandatory.
