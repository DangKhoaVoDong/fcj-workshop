# Event Report: “Workshop: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS”

### Event Objectives

- Provide a comprehensive overview of the AI/ML landscape and trends in Vietnam.
- Equip participants with foundational and in-depth knowledge of the AWS AI/ML toolset.
- Guide through the "end-to-end" Machine Learning process with Amazon SageMaker.
- Explore the power of Generative AI through Amazon Bedrock, from Prompt Engineering to building Chatbot applications.

### List of Speakers

- **Team of experts from AWS Vietnam (AWS Solutions Architects).**
- 
### Key Highlights

The event was divided into two main parts, progressing from traditional ML to the most advanced GenAI technologies:

#### 1. Overview of AWS AI/ML Services & Amazon SageMaker
- **AI Landscape in Vietnam:** Discussing opportunities and challenges when deploying AI in the local enterprise environment.
- **Amazon SageMaker – Comprehensive ML Platform:**
    - **Data Preparation:** Data preparation and labeling processes.
    - **Training & Tuning:** How to train models and fine-tune parameters for maximum accuracy.
    - **Deployment & MLOps:** Deploying models to production and managing the model lifecycle.
    - **Live Demo:** Visual experience of the SageMaker Studio interface.

#### 2. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock
- **Foundation Models (FMs):** Comparing the pros and cons of top foundation models like Claude, Llama, and Titan to choose the right fit for the problem.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Optimization techniques such as *Chain-of-Thought reasoning* and *Few-shot learning* to get the best results from the model.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Architecture combining models with private data (Knowledge Base) to minimize hallucinations and increase accuracy.
- **Bedrock Agents:** Building multi-step workflows and integrating external tools.
- **Guardrails:** Setting up content filters to ensure safety and policy compliance.

### Key Learnings

#### Technical Knowledge
- **SageMaker vs. Bedrock:** Clearly understood when to use SageMaker (to train custom models with specific data) and when to use Bedrock (to leverage the existing power of large Foundation Models).
- **RAG Architecture:** Mastered the mechanism of RAG - the key to bringing enterprise data into AI without retraining the model.
- **Responsible AI:** Understood the importance of controlling output content using Guardrails.

#### Practical Skills
- Learned how to design an effective Prompt to control AI behavior as desired.
- Visualized the data flow in a real-world Chatbot application.

### Application to Work

- **Solution Proposal:** In upcoming projects, if chatbot or text summarization features are needed, I will propose using Amazon Bedrock due to its convenience and fast integration.
- **Self-Study:** Dedicate time to practice *SageMaker JumpStart* labs to get familiar with deploying open-source models.
- **Process Improvement:** Apply the *MLOps* mindset to the software development process for better version control and automation.

### Event Experience

Participating in the **AI/ML/GenAI on AWS** workshop at the AWS Vietnam office was a very different experience compared to self-learning online.

#### Professional Environment
- Visiting the AWS office directly helped me feel the professional and dynamic working culture of a world-leading technology company.
- The workshop space was well-arranged, creating the best conditions for following demos and practicing.

#### Practical & Understandable Demos
- The Live Demo of building a Generative AI Chatbot using Bedrock was truly impressive. It showed me that integrating AI into applications is no longer as complicated and distant as before.
- The speakers explained difficult concepts like *Chain-of-Thought* or *RAG* in a very visual and easy-to-absorb manner.

#### Networking & Expansion
- The *Ice-breaker* session and Coffee Break helped me get to know many like-minded friends and enthusiastic mentors.

#### Key Takeaways
- The event helped me define my direction more clearly: Focusing on **Generative AI Application Development** rather than diving too deep into building core models from scratch.
