During my internship at **First Cloud Journey** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 12, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge equipped at university into a real-world working environment.

I participated in **researching and deploying solutions on the AWS platform**, thereby improving my skills in **researching new technologies, operating Cloud systems, and effective teamwork**.

Regarding work ethic, I always try to complete tasks well and actively communicate with colleagues to improve work efficiency. However, I realize that I need to be stricter with myself regarding discipline.

To objectively reflect on the internship process, I would like to self-assess based on the following criteria:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |

| 4 | **Responsibility** | Completing work on time, ensuring quality | ✅ | | |
| 5 | **Discipline** | Adhering to time, rules, and work processes | | | ✅ |
| 6 | **Progressiveness** | Willingness to receive feedback and improve oneself | | ✅ | |
| 7 | **Communication** | Presenting ideas and reporting work clearly | | ✅ | |

### Areas for Improvement

Through self-reflection, I have identified areas that need to be addressed to improve myself in the future:

* **Enhance Discipline:** Strictly adhere to company and organizational regulations, especially regarding punctuality and administrative processes.
* **Improve Problem-Solving Mindset:** Practice viewing problems from multiple perspectives and proposing systematic, creative solutions rather than just addressing immediate symptoms.
* **Communication Skills:** Learn to express ideas more concisely and clearly during daily meetings, and practice calmness and tact when handling arising situations or conflicts.
